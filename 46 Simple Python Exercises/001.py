# Define a function max()that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the
# largest of them. Use the if thenÂ­ else construct available in Python.
# (It is true that Python has the max()function built in, but writing it
# yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)


def max(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return n
    else:
        return m


if __name__ == '__main__':
    msg = "Highest number from 2 and 7 is: {}".format(max(2, 7))
    print(msg)
